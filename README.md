## Project Summary

We will take an I94 dataset of over 40 million records on immigration from the Department of Homeland Security and turn it into the fact table of a star schema database with demographic data from the US Census Bureau and airport data from OurAirports as dimension tables.  
We then clean the data and where possible add the corresponding name fields of code fields.


## Instructions
* Run [Capstone Project Template.ipynb](https://github.com/MarkNoordraven/Data-Engineering-Nanodegree-CapstoneProject/blob/master/Capstone%20Project%20Template.ipynb) for the code that fetches the data, cleans and enriches the data and transforms it into a database.
